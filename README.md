**Project 2 - Treehouse Front End Web Deveopment Techdegree**
***Mobile-first Responsive Layout***

In this project, I was given starter files that included mockups of how the portfolio page should look for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.  Also included were the content images included on the page.  The instructions for the project included creating all content in an index.html file.  Then to create a css file to style the page to match the mocks ups, first for mobile @320px, then to add in media queries for tablet @768px and desktop @1024px.  Using ids, the navigation links target different sections of the page.  All files were checked against html and css validators for errors.  

***Exceeds Expectations***

  * Used a "subtle background image" with a transparent gradient overlay for the body
  * Text color changed for H1, H2, and a tags 
  * Additional Google Font used - one used for p tags, the other for all other text
